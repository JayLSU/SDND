# SDND
## This repository is created for learning the [Udacity self-driving car nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013 "Self-Driving Car Nanodegree").  Currently, it only contains TERM 1 (from Jan. 18th until Apr. 30th).
In this repository, I will update my progress for SDND study, including:

1. Practice coding.
2. Projects.
3. Necessary notes.

Since I will use Udacity resources, there are another repositories for Udacity SDND materials cloned from [Udacity github](https://github.com/udacity "Udacity Github") corresponding repository.
